##### Saturday, June 11th 2021

</center>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Make sure you put your phone on silent

2. Git clone this `Students_Jan_2021_Reviews` folder to your computer. If you already have it from a previous exam, then `git pull` within this repository's folder to update your local repository.

3. Copy this `02_Snap_2` folder over to your personal repository within github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

   For example, get the questions from

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2021_Reviews/02_Snap_2`

   And push your answers to

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/02_Snap_2`

4. This review is in 1 part:
   1. **Practical (100%)**. There is one practical question you must answer to receive a passing grade. Please attempt it since partial credit is given!

5. Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your fixed code to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository. There will be no grace time given after 10:00 am. Hence, please do complete as much as you can and commit/push your answers on or before time.

### INTEGRITY:

Some ground rules you are expected to follow:

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too.
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#\midterm** so that all students have access to the same clarification.

### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. You are expected to complete this in 1 hr. You may complete your answers for learning and experimentation purposes, at a later time. Your answers committed and pushed before the specified time will be evaluated.

2. This exam tests your knowledge and ability to debug your code. If you do not find all the bugs answer, that's ok.  Try to fix as many as you can.
