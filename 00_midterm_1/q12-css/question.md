### Question:

Please use your own simple words to describe what are cascading rules in CSS. Please keep it under 150 words. Full credit given to simple explanation in own words and not a copy and paste from the documentation ;-)

### Answer:
In CSS, cascading rules control the visual style of HTML elements based on a hierarchical order of selectability, in addition to actual order in the CSS file. CSS uses selectors that can be used broadly or acutely to target many items at once, or certain elements independently, which help to make styling more efficient.
