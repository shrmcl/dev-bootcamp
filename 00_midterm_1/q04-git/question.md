1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

2. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?

### Please post your answer here. Please use your own words and do it within 50 words for each question.
1. `git pull` updates your working directory with the updates from the repo it's cloned from. `git fetch` retrieves data about updated changes without altering your working directroy.

2. We use the staging area to tell git what files to add or change in the github repo, which gives us control over what we commit to the repo.


### Feedback:
Correct. I'll suggest 
1. pull = fetch + merge (your language is correct)
2. here you do this to club files and/or changes together to commit as a single commit object.

Full score.
