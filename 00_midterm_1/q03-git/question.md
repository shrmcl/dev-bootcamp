### Question 3:

Please answer the following with maximum 50 words each (keep it short):

1. Give at least 2 reasons why git/github are useful for a solo developer.
2. Give at least 2 other reasons why git/github are useful to a team of developers.


### Please post your answer here:
1. A solo developer benefits by being able to save versions of a projects over time. The developer can easily revert to previous iterations of the code, and branch existing code into multiple options of the same project. This is great for sharing with clents/stakeholders for feedback.

2. Teamm members can work simultaneously on one project and merge code when ready. It also makes sharing code easy.
