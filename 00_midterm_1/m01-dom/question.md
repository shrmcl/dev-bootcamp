### When working with the DOM, what does code below select?

            document.querySelector("div.intro")

1. the first div with a class of "intro"
2. the first div with an id of "intro"
3. all div's with a class of "intro"
4. all div's with an id of "intro"
5. selects nothing

Hint: if you are not sure, please setup a simple test page with 2 div's as described above and console.log the DOM selection and see
what you get.
