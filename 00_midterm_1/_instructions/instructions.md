# ACC Software Bootcamp - Midterm Review #1

</center>

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Git clone this `Students_Jan_2021_Reviews` folder to your computer.

2.  Copy the `01_midterm` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp repo, so you can edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Sep_2020_Reviews/01_midterm`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/01_midterm`

3.  There's a folder for each question. Please write your answers within the respective folder's `question.md` file.

4.  This review is in 3 parts

    1. **Section 1: Multiple choice questions**. 40% of the credit. Please choose one best answer.

    2. **Section 2: Small questions**. 30% of the credit.

       (answer any 10 from the questions from this section provided. Please mark the ones you skip as "SKIPPED", else they would be considered for grading and may lower your score)

    3. **Section 3: Practical portion**. 30% of the credit. Only attempt one of the two provided in instructions for the practical.

5.  This review is open book. You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors/mentors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a mentor to show you the way, but not do the work for you. Do not ask another student.

6.  If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

7.  To make sure you have enough time for all short questions, return to the difficult ones later. They are not numbered in any particular order.

8.  Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only.

## TIME AVAILABLE

1. Please complete and git push your answers to this review exam within 4 hours.

2. Also, if you wish, you may complete any incomplete answers and push them again before 5 pm on the day of the test. Answers after 1p would attract a 20% penalty. Hence complete and push as much as you can before 1p.

## INTEGRITY:

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need an honest answer. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research and thinking. It is more important to learn from this experience, than to bypass it. As such, here are some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers, between students.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- Absolutely no sharing of screens.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#midterm** such that all students have access to the same clarification.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?"? Your answer should be within a sentence or two. Long answers are not needed as they take away precious time. Full credit given for answers in your own simple language that shows your understanding.

2. How complete is your answer and/or your code. Code is complete if it can handle all possible inputs, e.g. user error, no inputs or inputs of wrong datatype. For example, what if the user entered nothing, or a string data type, into a function that must have a numeric input? Or the user enters 1.5 into a function that requires an integer?

3. Have you annotated your code with COMMENTS so it is reasonably understandable? Have you indented your code appropriately so an instructor can follow your code? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution. Lack of comments will attract -25% credit.

4. Does your code work, where applicable?

## SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for being considered as successful.

2. Credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions, unless indicated.

3. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work. Even non-working code may attract enough credit to put you over the 70% mark. Some life lessons here :=)
