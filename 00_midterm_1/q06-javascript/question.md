### Question 6:

Write a Javascript loop that will iterate from 1 to 5, both included, and log if the number is odd or even.

Now put this code into a function that takes appropriate inputs as arguments (e.g. 1, 5) and returns an object like the following.

    {
      1: "odd",
      2: "even",
      3: "odd",
      4: "even",
      5: "odd"
    }
