### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone or git pull the https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2021_Reviews repository. 

1. Copy the Final Assessment folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp group's personal repository, so you may edit the contents there and push them.  

    For example, get the questions from

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2021_Reviews/03_FINAL

    And push your answers to

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/03_FINAL

    
1. View the questions by using the preview feature built into VSCode, or on github.com within this repo, to be able to see the rendered code screenshots.

1. There's a folder for each question type and each question.  Please paste your answers within the respective folder, as appropriate.  

1. This assessment is in 3 parts

    1. **Multiple choice questions**. These have equal weight and add upto 24% of the evaluation. Please answer any all questions.

    2. **Small practice questions**.  These have equal weight and total upto 50% of the evaluation.

    3. **Practical portion**.  This is a small project, that has 26% of the evaluation.

1. This assessment is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a peer to show you the way, but not do the work for you.

1. If a code snippet on the assessment has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

1. Please git commit, git push your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only.

### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this final assessment is a test of how well prepared you are. A sincere effort would help you learn by taking exam. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research and testing. 

It is important to learn from this experience. As such, let us set some ground rules

- Please do not share direct or indirect answers with others.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#midterm** such that all students have access to it.


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?" where asked? 

1. Does your code have comments, where possible? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution.

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle multiple possible inputs, e.g. user error or no input.

1. Have you indented your code appropriately? 

1. Does your code work, where applicable?


### TIME AVAILABLE, PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. This assessment may be completed within 4-8 hours depending on your ability and speed. However, you may take upto 11:59 pm (midnight) on the review day to complete the assessment. Please remember to commit/push your answers before then.

1. 70% of overall score is needed for PASS status. 

1. Some credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence, please do not skip questions.

1. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work.

1. Some questions are super easy, some are more challenging. To make sure you have enough time for all short questions, pace yourself, return to the difficult ones later. We recommend you attempt all questions, as seemingly difficult questions turn out to be not so difficult.

1. Some questions are designed to not test your knowledge, but your ability to quickly research a topic, understand it and use it or explain it. Hence don't skip questions that seem unfamiliar to you.

1. If you do not succeed at this assessment, you will get another opportunity to retake the assessment, by date before the end of the current term (e.g. before the end of the summer semester at ACC).

Good luck!
