##### Saturday, May 22nd 2021

</center>

### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone this `Students_Jan_2021_Reviews` folder to your computer. If you already have it from a previous assessment, then `git pull` within this repository's folder to update your local repository.

1. Copy this `01_snap_1` folder over to your personal repository within github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

   For example, get the questions from

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2021_Reviews/01_snap_1`

   And push your answers to

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/01_snap_1`

1. There's a folder for each question. You can create additional files within the folder if it helps you arrive at an answer and demonstrate your solution.

1. This review is in 2 parts:

   1. **Multiple choice questions (63%)**. These questions have equal weight.

   2. **Practical (37%)**. Do not skip the practical, in order to stay above passing level. Partial work will receive some credit. You only need to answer one of the practical questions - do not answer more than one. Answering more than one is an automatic -10% deduction.

1. This review is open book. You may use suitable references available to you to answer the questions.

1. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please fix it and then answer.

### INTEGRITY:

Some ground rules you are expected to follow:

1. No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
1. Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
1. No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too.
1. Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#\_reviews** so that all students have access to the same clarification.
1. If you must copy code from the internet, alter it to your style. Also, you MUST provide comments to display your understanding of the concepts; else copied code from the internet would attract 100% penalty.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of your ability to follow instructions.

2. Evidence of your ability to explain your answer(s) through comments within code or through free form text as requested(!)

3. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question.

4. Does your code work, where applicable?
